// what's a Unix pipe?
// makes it very powerfull
// Here's an example
Pipes are powerful. 
Functional programming
Infix operator | to chain commands. 
It's what makes the Unix command line so flexible. 


Example: Unix: "|":

Now you understand why I picked this title. Please know that I only chose the title because of the quote. I'm not saying they're poorly implemented. 
It's great!

It's interesting how users of the language are completely blown away by it, not knowing it's been around for a very long time.

Here are a few programming languages 
either library or native.

Conceptual level.
The commands in a Unix pipeline are executed in parallel
