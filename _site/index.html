  <h2>Data Science Consulting &amp; Training</h2>

    <p>
      You have data. I'm a data scientist. Let me help you gain more insight, make better decisions, and build smarter products. No matter where you're located, what market you operate in, or what stage you're at, I'd love to hear about you and your data. Simply drop me an email at <a onclick="trackConv(980920438, 'xuRACI3PzVwQ9tDe0wM');" href="mailto:datascience@jeroenjanssens.com">datascience@jeroenjanssens.com</a> and we'll take it from there.
    </p>

  <h3>About Me</h3>

    <p>
      <a href="/img/jeroenjanssens.jpg"><img id="face" title="Jeroen Janssens" alt="Jeroen Janssens" src="/img/jeroenjanssens.jpg" /></a>
      Through consulting and training, I help companies getting the most out of their data. Previously, I was a Lead Data Scientist at Elsevier in Amsterdam. Prior to that, I worked in New York City at YPlan and Visual Revenue (which got acquired by Outbrain). I have an MSc in Artificial Intelligence and a PhD in Machine Learning. Recently, I wrote a book titled <a href="http://datascienceatthecommandline.com">Data Science at the Command Line</a>. My <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/jeroenjanssens">LinkedIn profile</a> provides a more detailed overview of my background.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have experience and affinity with: analyzing data using R and the Python scientific stack; organizing workshops and meetups; writing and presenting for technical audiences; managing data in MySQL, MongoDB, Redis, and AWS S3; collaborating with international teams of engineers and data scientists; programming in Python, JavaScript, and Bash; visualizing data with ggplot, TikZ, and D3; and performing large, distributed experiments.
    </p>

  <h3>Areas of Expertise</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h4>Data strategy</h4>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Data processing</h4>
        <!--ETL-->
        <!--Getting data from one place to another. Cleaning it.-->
        <!--Automate it.-->
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Data visualization and analysis</h4>
        <!--communicating data, gaining insight-->
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Machine learning</h4>
        <!--During my PhD, I learned a lot about the theory of machine learning.-->
         <!--Since then, I've had plenty of experience deploying various algorithms in production, mostly in an agile manner.-->
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Building prototypes</h4>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    </p>

  <h3>Professional Training</h3>

    <p>
      I currently offer two hands-on, full-day courses aimed at data scientists and engineers:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><h4>Data Science at the Command Line</h4></li>
      <li><h4>Introduction to Machine Learning with Python</h4></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Besides these two predefined courses, I can also deliver a custom course based on any of the technologies listed in the about section. To make the course more engaging and relevant, I can incorporate custom use cases based on your data and day-to-day challenges.
    </p>

  <h3>Endorsements</h3>

    <div class="left">
      <blockquote>
        <p>Jeroen came to our offices in Barcelona to deliver a one-day workshop on command-line tools for data science. I believe a lot in command-line tools to increase productivity, as well as giving access to data to the different teams, not only data analysts. Besides demonstrating a good knowledge and experience in command line tools for data science, Jeroen has very good training skills, his communication is clear, and he'll manage to adapt the level of the training to the level of the audience, which is not always easy!</p>
        <cite>Marc Canaleta, CTO at Social Point</cite>

    <div class="right">
      <blockquote>
        <p>One of the most important skills of a data scientist is exploration: of a new data set, or of new results produced by modeling. The UNIX philosophy of simple tools, each doing one job well, then cleverly piped together, is embodied by the command line. Jeroen expertly discusses how to bring that philosophy into your work in data science, illustrating how the command line is not only the world of file input/output, but also the world of data manipulation, exploration, and even modeling.</p>

    <class="left">
      <blockquote>
        <p>Jeroen is a great person to have on your team&mdash;not only has he built our event recommendation system and helped the team with every-day questions around our customers and data but he also organized a Python meetup at our NYC office, wrote a book (no small feat!), and performed in an occasional beat-boxing competition here and there.</p>
        <cite>Viktoras Jucikas, Founder and CTO at YPlan</cite>
      </blockquote>
    </div>

    <div class="right">
      <blockquote>
        <p>I wholeheartedly recommend Jeroen Janssens for his programming and data analysis skills. His efficiency in implementing software prototypes is impressive. On top of that, he is a great communicator. During my collaboration with Jeroen I witnessed his skills in impressing academics, engineers, and managers with clear and appealing presentations and explanations. His extensive knowledge of the theory of machine learning algorithms and the practice of data analysis is unique.</p>
