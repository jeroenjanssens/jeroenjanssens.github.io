  <h3>About me</h3>

    <p>
      <a href="/img/jeroenjanssens.jpg"><img id="face" title="Jeroen Janssens" alt="Jeroen Janssens" src="/img/jeroenjanssens.jpg" /></a>

 I'm the founder and CEO of <a href="https://datascienceworkshops.com">Data Science Workshops</a>, which provides on-the-job training and coaching in data visualisation, machine learning, and programming. For one day a week, I'm an assistant professor at Jheronimus Academy of Data Science. Previously, I was a data scientist at Elsevier in Amsterdam and startups YPlan and Outbrain in New York City. I have an MSc in artificial intelligence from Maastricht University and a PhD in machine learning from Tilburg University. Recently, I wrote a book titled <a href="http://datascienceatthecommandline.com">Data Science at the Command Line</a>, which was published by O'Reilly Media. My <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/jeroenjanssens">LinkedIn profile</a> provides a more detailed overview of my background.

In January 2017, after having done various data science projects and workshops as a consultant, I decided to start a new company that focuses on training and coaching. <a href="https://datascienceworkshops.com">Data Science Workshops</a> provides hands-on workshops, inspiring masterclasses, and complete in-company courses in subjects such as data visualization, programming, and machine learning. Although we're technically still young, we already had the pleasure of helping <a href="https://datascienceworkshops.com/clients">some great organizations</a>.

    <h3>Data Science at the Command Line</h3>

During my time in New York City, I was given the opportunity to write a book titled 
<a href="http://datascienceatthecommandline.com">Data Science at the Command Line</a>, which was published by O'Reilly Media in 2014. From the cover: This hands-on guide demonstrates how the flexibility of the command line can help you become a more efficient and productive data scientist. You'll learn how to combine small, yet powerful, command-line tools to quickly obtain, scrub, explore, and model your data. Discover why the command line is an agile, scalable, and extensible technology. Even if you're already comfortable processing data with, say, Python or R, you'll greatly improve your data science workflow by also leveraging the power of the command line.
