  <h3>About me</h3>

Hi there! My name is Jeroen, I'm based in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, and I like to think of myself as a data scientist, teacher, author, and entrepreneur. Allow me to explain. I'm the founder and CEO of <a href="https://datascienceworkshops.com">Data Science Workshops</a>, which provides on-the-job training and coaching in data visualisation, machine learning, and programming. For one day a week, I'm an assistant professor at Jheronimus Academy of Data Science in Den Bosch. Previously, I was a data scientist at Elsevier in Amsterdam and startups YPlan and Outbrain in New York City. I have an MSc in artificial intelligence from Maastricht University and a PhD in machine learning from Tilburg University. I wrote a book titled <a href="http://datascienceatthecommandline.com">Data Science at the Command Line</a>, which was published by O'Reilly Media. My <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/jeroenjanssens">LinkedIn profile</a> provides a more detailed overview of my background.

    <h3>Data Science Workshops</h3>

      During 2015 and 2016 I did several projects and gave various workshops as an independent data scientist. After a while, I came to understand three things:
      (1)&nbsp;the need for data science skills and knowledge is increasing while hiring good data scientists remains challenging,
      (2)&nbsp;organizations often have more people with an affinity for data (such as business analysts, marketeers, and developers) than they realize, and
      (3)&nbsp;many of these people are interested in and fully capable of acquiring the right data science skills and knowledge.
So in January 2017, I decided to start a new company that focuses on training and coaching. <a href="https://datascienceworkshops.com">Data Science Workshops</a> provides hands-on workshops, inspiring masterclasses, and complete in-company courses in subjects such as data visualization, programming, and machine learning. Although we're still young, we already had the pleasure of helping <a href="https://datascienceworkshops.com/clients">some great organizations</a>.

    <h3>Data Science at the Command Line</h3>

During my time in New York City, I was given the opportunity to write a book titled 
<a href="http://datascienceatthecommandline.com">Data Science at the Command Line</a>, which was published by O'Reilly Media in 2014. From the cover: This hands-on guide demonstrates how the flexibility of the command line can help you become a more efficient and productive data scientist. You'll learn how to combine small, yet powerful, command-line tools to quickly obtain, scrub, explore, and model your data. Discover why the command line is an agile, scalable, and extensible technology. Even if you're already comfortable processing data with, say, Python or R, you'll greatly improve your data science workflow by also leveraging the power of the command line.
