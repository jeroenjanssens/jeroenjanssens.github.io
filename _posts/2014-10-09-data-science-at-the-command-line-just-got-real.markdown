I'm happy to tell you that my book Data Science at the Command Line just came out.

Its [companion website](http://datascienceatthecommandline.com) contains information about where to get it, past and upcoming related events, all the command-line tools it discusses, and the associated virtual machine. Now that the book is finished, I'm looking forward to write some more blog posts again.

Best,

Jeroen
