Last Monday I gave an Ignite talk at [Strata NYC][ignite] about using command-line tools for data science.
Giving a talk where the slides auto-advance after 15 seconds is a challenging, but ultimately very rewarding experience! Even though the preview image below suggests otherwise, there's no beatboxing in this video.

On a related note, I'm writing a book titled "Data Science at the Command-line", which will be published by O'Reilly somewhere in 2014. If you're interested in receiving updates regarding the book then you should [follow me on Twitter][twitter].
